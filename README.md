# W-W-Spell-Generator
This project is meant to help generate random spell lists for upper level NPCs according to the D&D 5th edition Homebrew Wands and Wizards.  Depending on attributes of the chacters, the spell lists can be lengthy.  This can be a time consuming process for NPCs that need a little depth, but that a GM may not want to spend too much time on.
